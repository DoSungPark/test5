Our mission is to analyze consumer purchase histories to discover patterns between products and represent these insights as quantified data. 
We aim to establish an API pipeline and visualize the results as charts on the web for user access. 
Through this process, sellers will be able to develop more effective marketing strategies and enhance customer satisfaction. 
Additionally, consumers (both retail and wholesale buyers) will enjoy a better shopping experience with personalized recommendations.
